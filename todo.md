# ToDo List

- [x] Update the theme changer callback to callback to a function to update the
      icons for Github and LinkedIn in the footer.

- [x] Update Navbar to collapse when the device width is too small.

- [x] Update container div to expand as the device width gets smaller.

- [ ] Set an upper bound on the width for the container div for things like wide
      monitors.

- [ ] Set up the database interactions and set up functions to access database
      information.

- [ ] Set up the markdown renderer and set up functions to convert markdown to
      HTML. Decide between creating objects each time vs retaining objects
      permanently.

- [ ] Don't use the TOC extension write your own parser so that it can be used
      in a custom way. Double check the IDs that are given to each of the
      headers.

- [ ] Set up a simple way to generate UUIDs and common operations on UUIDs.

- [ ] Set up a way to hash passwords and compare passwords using bcrypt.
